The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is the first free trade agreement entered into by the United States.
Signed in 1985, it aims to eliminate trade barriers and promote economic cooperation between the United States and Israel.
Under the agreement, tariffs on industrial and agricultural goods between the two nations are reduced or eliminated,
making it easier for companies in both countries to do business.

The FTA has provisions to resolve trade disputes and protect intellectual property rights.
It serves as a model for other trade agreements and strengthens the economic ties between the two nations.

The agreement has significantly increased trade volume, benefiting industries like technology, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals.
